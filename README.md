## Introduction
Welcome to satoshis.place, if you're a developer and you are interesting in making apps, services or bots you'll find information here on how to interact with the API.

**Note: You won't find the source code for satoshis.place here, the project is not open source and there are no plans to do publish the code yet)**

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions at all, feel free to open an issue and obviously any PRs to contribute towards this documentation are also welcome!

## Overview
Satoshi's place is a type of Lightning Network powered app (Lapp) that runs an open, permissionless and collaborative art board. Each pixel costs 1 satoshi to paint and can be painted over and over again. If you haven't seen it yet, [go check it out first](https://satoshis.place).

The aim of the project is to give everyone a fun, easy and cheap way to experience the power of the Bitcoin Lightning Network. But there's more to it, with the advent of microstransactions and programmatic money, we can actually build Lapps that interact with each other and even provide value added services. In the case of satoshis.place, some of the interesting things to build are:

### Bots
- Upload and draw pictures
- Protect a drawing
- Animate a drawing

### Tools
- Different paint brush sizes
- Spray paint
- Shapes (circles, rectangles, stars)

### Analytics
- Activity heatmaps
- General stats (i.e. txs/day, pixels/day)
- Timelapses

All of ideas above can be implemented today in some form or another with the existing API. They can be built as separate services / websites / apps which can even monetize themselves by creating their own lightning invoices with a surchage for the service they provide.

If you need to setup a lightning network node, take a look at the excellent [lnd](# satoshis.place
